# Week-3-Assignment
DS 3001 week three assignment 
One of your team members should create a new repo and manage access by giving write access to team members by added them as contributors.

Dividing the graph into three phases: 1) getting data loaded, 2) selecting the aes/adding labels, 3) and adding finishing details, assign a team member to each task.

Each team member takes a turn contributing at each stage. If you have four team members divide the third step into 2 steps and build four graphes.

Pull requests allow for one feature to be added to your script. Create a new fork for each feature, download clone to repo, develop the new code, push the code to the fork and create a a pull request.

Verbs in order: fork, clone, develop code, push, and pull request

Whomever is leading the first phase (getting data loaded) will also complete the merging of the pull request(s) from the feature branch into the main branch.

Use a different datasets and produce different graphs for each dataset (don't push 3 scatter plots)

Have separate Rscript or Rmarkdown files for each visualization.

Submit to collab the URL for the orginal(origin) repo.
